# Goodreads Book Recommendation Project

This project implements a book recommendation system using datasets downloaded from [UCSD Goodreads Dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/goodreads.html#datasets). The following data files were used in this project:

- liked_books  
- book_id_map  
- books_titles  
- goodreads_books  
- goodreads_interactions  

The project was developed and tested using **Jupyter Notebook**, which provides an interactive environment for running and visualizing the code.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to recommend books you might like based on the books you already enjoy. It uses book ratings data and metadata from Goodreads to find similar users and suggest books based on their preferences.

## How to Use

- Search for books you like using the built search engine in the notebook.
- Create a list of books you like.
- Generate book recommendations based on your preferences and the ratings data.

## Data Sources

The data was obtained from the UCSD Goodreads Dataset as linked above.
